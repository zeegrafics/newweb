          <h3> UX Design</h3>
          <p>
            User experience design process is an iterative method that helps you continuously improve and polish your
            design.

            <h2>Understand and Research</h2>
            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>I completed a Competitive Analysis of two similar app to assess how competitors of my app have design
              their
              app and how they are fulfilling the requirements of the users. By identifying the competitors strength and
              weaknesses, I was able to analyze how users are interacting with these products and determine what gaps my
              product potentially fill in. I analyzed competitors Key Objectives, their overall strategy and their
              market
              advantage. Competitors Market profile and SWOT profile provided me useful information in the development
              of my
              strategy.</p>
            <img src="img/swot.jpg">
            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>During this project I used multiple research methods. I started my research with user surveys that not
              only
              provided me valuable feedback but also helped me to create question for user interview. Research covered
              qualitative and quantitative methods, as well as attitudinal and behavioral. Each method provided me the
              data
              which made my steps easy to complete this project.</p>
            <h4>Research Goals</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>To find out what is user first choice to solve their problems </li>
              <li>Does user prefer text communication or video communication? </li>
              <li>Get insights of the user’s expectations from this app</li>
              <li>Are they comfortable sharing their payment information online</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>User Interview</h3>
            <p>An interview script with a list of open-ended questions that targeted the motivation and factors that
              influence as user to surf. I engaged my audience using my personal networks and social media as well as
              coworkers who are active using different apps. Using this combination helped me to find the input of
              different
              users from different fields. I consolidated my results using the process of Affinity mapping which helped
              me
              to isolate information and determine how it relates to other bits of information achieving my research
              goals.

                    <li>People are looking for expert and professional advice for their problems</li>
                    <li>People need a confidence that the source they are using will definitely solve their problem.
                    </li>
                    <li>People are not sure the solution they are getting is from verified source or is from just
                      another
                      person who had the same problem they are facing. </li>
                    <li>People don’t want to waste their time online, browsing multiple sources to solve their problems.
                      They
                      need one stop shop </li>
                    <li>People want to keep the record of the solutions they get from experts. So in future if they face
                      same
                      problem they can revisit the solution they got in past. </li>
                    <li>People want to communicate directly with the person they are getting advice from, either video
                      source,
                      audio or live text chat. </li>
                    <li>People need a confirmation that the payment platform is secure and reliable to share their

              <h3>User Personas</h3>
              <p>The data I got from research conducting interviews and affinity maps I created User persons and user
                stories.
                I created 3 personas and gave them different names and roles. Personas helped me to find more details
                regarding their goals, needs, motivations and frustrations.
                User stories helped me to define what my user wants to accomplish. Understanding human needs for real
                life
                situation helped me to find the solutions and necessary functionality form user’s perspective.</p>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-8">
                  <img src="img/UserPersona.jpg">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-4">
                  My personas were from different fields with different needs. Creating different persona reflected the
                  need
                  of different user from different environment
                </div>
              </div>
              <h2>User Journey & User Flow</h2>
              <p>I created User journey maps to understand the visualizing processes a user goes through in order to
                accomplish a goal. After establishing the individual objectives, user flows were created to see the
                steps user
                would have to take in order to complete a task.</p>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-7">

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-5">
                  <p>The user flow helped me to understand how user must interact with to complete a task or achieve a
                    goal on
                    my app. It provided a clear process of each persona showcasing different solutions to each of their
                    problems.</p>

                <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-4">
                  <p>After reviewing User flows and user journey, my next step was to create a site map. The basic idea
                    of
                    site map is to organize content so that users would easily adjust to the functionality of the app
                    and
                    could find everything they need without big effort.</p>

                    <h3>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
                    <p>I generated my ideas and work on basic sketches. I drew low-fidelity wireframes to serve as the
                      first
                      visual of my app.</p>

                    <p>I used Balsamiq to convert my Low-Fidelity wireframes to Mid Fidelity prototypes. These
                      prototypes
                      portrayed a bit more detail than low-fidelity prototypes.</p>

                <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                <p>Now the app was ready for Usability testing. I developed Usability Test Plan to outline my goals,
                  scope and
                  logistics of the testing sessions. A test script was also created to conduct an effective usability
                  test.
                </p>
                <p>Usability tests were conducted with 6 individual participants to determine the current usability and
                  sense
                  of the prototype for the expert application "GET ANSWERED". This prototype is incomplete but has the
                  main
                  search, contacts and navigation functions ready to be tested by potential users. These tests were both
                  conducted in person as well as via  Skype screen sharing and Proto.io to run the prototype. Each
                  test
                  had audio and video recording using external mobile phone cameras.</p>

                <h3>Analysis and Reporting</h3>
                <p>As a result of conducting usability tests different feedbacks were received. All test results were
                  clustered with the help of affinity mapping and then gathered within a rainbow spread sheet.</p>

                    The objective was to determine if participants understand what the app is about quickly and easily
                    (i.e.,
                    an application to solve their solutions with the help of professionals in the field) and the value
                    it
                    provides.

                    Observe how users navigate and find information about finding the solution from the homepage—can
